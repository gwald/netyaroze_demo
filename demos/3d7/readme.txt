Screen-textured surfaces in 3d demo

                                    

A small inner cube, a larger outer one,
six special polygons placed near the surfaces of the outer cubes.


Each of the six has the texture-page of the screen
i.e. attempts to be a screen-picture texture.
But this isn't fully sorted, it wobbles and flickers,
but it isn't far off, and not hard to perfect.

The demo runs well within a frame, ie easily runs at 60fps
NTSC or 50fps PAL.

The reflective polygons are simply given a texture rectangle
which is that of the screen.
(Under the present code, it makes no difference to the flicker
which of the two buffers are used).

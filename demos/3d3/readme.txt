Basic 3d demo



Cube: made out of 16bit dynamically created textures
     


Change projection: see the visual effect of this,
also how it affects clipping; use L1 and Rpad

Move the viewpoint in GsRVIEW2:
view always looks from view.vp to view.vr; use L2 and Rpad



Nice simple camera mode: six basic moves, matrix re-sorting;
tells you which face is viewed, and angle onto it,
by inspecting the view (world->screen) matrix


View distance from world origin: use Lright and Rpad to modify


ViewMoveTime: use Lleft and Rpad

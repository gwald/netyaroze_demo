3d sprite and object sorting:
    correct way to call GsSortObject4

    sorted the SortSpriteObjectPosition, transforming world to screen coords:
    hence, the sprite object is in right place, gets obscured and obscures
    others at right depth.

Use L2 with Rpad to move 3d sprite around
    


Nice simple camera mode: six basic moves, matrix re-sorting,
use Rpad alone for view moves

November work
-------------

Demos for Net Yaroze


system functionality:
	trigonometry LUT package: rsin, rcos, rtan, rasin, racos, ratan
	light sources, background lighting, fogging
	view and projection distortions
	basic TMD viewer 
	TIM viewer (Stuart)  
	text printing utility (Stuart)


3D object manipulation:
	object scaling
	various object viewing modes
	move and rotate wrt world
	move and rotate wrt object
	express objects in any coordinate system, hence 3D navigation



Demo games:
	full design for tunnel-based driving/flying game
	in either 2 or 3D, only partly implemented

	3D world with 2D dynamics
	3D world with 3D dynamics
		both are descent-style 3D shoot-em-up games






Plans for December
------------------


	Complete the TMD viewer


	full TMD utility: module enabling total read-access and 
	runtime manipulation of 3D models:
		
		get tmd info -> entire TMD rendered explicit

		manipulations:
			runtime retexturing
			texture effects: colour, brightness etc
			flip inside/out
			find TMD dimensions -> proper collision detection
			polygon scaling
			subpart manipulation:
				eg tag parts of TMD of man: 'head', 'left arm' etc
				then generate TMD animation by moving subparts independently


	Sound utility module:
		background tunes
		single sounds (eg when fire shot / shot hits something)
		sound effects



	Completion of demo games:

		3D fly-around-and-shoot game
			(in open arena, landscape, maze; guns, shields;
			single-ship dog-fighting, multi-ship strategy control)

		Track/tunnel-based driving/flying game (2D or 3D, with or without guns)

		Platform game (requires at least one creature-TMD we can animate)

		

	


	






Suggestions for improvements
----------------------------




	1.	Provision of large stock of models, textures and sounds,
			both for SCEE demos and for Yaroze in general (put onto website?)


	2.	Training sessions on aspects of game design and programming:
		especially in the areas of speed optimisations,
		graphical enhancements and 3D geometry	


	3.	Clarification of the direction that the Yaroze sample demos should go in.
			I see four main purposes:

			(1)		creation of useful reusable software modules for those that want
				to write games for Yaroze:
				e.g. TIM, TMD, padd, sound handler modules
				runtime TIM and TMD alteration modules
			

			(2)	creation of extra utilities that will speed up Yaroze development
				eg proper TIM and TMD viewers


			(3) 	functionality demonstration and instruction
				i.e. sample programs that both show what can be done with
				PlayStation programming on Yaroze, and show just how to do it
				by well-written and documented source code
			
			 

			(4)	marketing/promotion: writing good-looking games to show to
				prospective Yaroze customers / to generate interest generally.
				
				
				
	
		So far most of the work has been with (3),
			with several spin-offs into (1) and (2). Some demos have been developed
			into games, but are not sufficiently graphically enhanced to
			be used as promotion games.


		We have limited time and people for the Yaroze code, and must decide
			what to prioritise: functional demos, demonstrable games
			or hybrids of both.

For the attention of Mr Masawi



    Here are the photocopies of my passport.

    I think you still have my work reference letter,
    the original; please return this to me as I will need
    it again soon, feel free to take photocopies of it first.


        See you soon



                Lewis Evans  (11 Soane Court)

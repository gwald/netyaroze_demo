Movement and rotation:

each of these can (independently) be done
either wrt world axes, or wrt object's own axes

easy to move/rotate relative to Any coordinate system

Also want to be able to move object as ship,
while it spins massively: 
ie movement Uninfluenced by spinning.

achieve this using two matrices for the object,
one its display/object-handler matrix,
which is influenced by the spinning;
the other, its movement matrix, which isn't.






World clipping:
	basically, only draw objects within a given cuboid of the
	viewpoint, i.e. only draw near objects/ objects in our field of 
	close view, to get a speed-up.

	Set coordinate system for viewpoint,
	express object O1 in that coordinate system,
	hence easy to test if it inside cuboid, 
	hence know whether or not to add O1 to list of DrawnObjects.

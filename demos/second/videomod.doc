Video Mode and Net Yaroze
-------------------------




		There are two different video modes, PAL and NTSC;
	many TVs support only one of these, though some support both.
		


		In Europe, PAL is the standard.



		Signs that the program is running under the wrong videomode:

	(1) everything is black and white
	
	(2) the screen height seems wrong, there are either black bars
		above and below the screen, or some of the bottom of the picture
		is not making it onto the screen.
		
		
	How to deal with this:

		(1)		in software, call GetVideoMode() to find	
				what video mode you are currently in;
				call SetVideoMode(MODE_PAL) or SetVideoMode(MODE_NTSC)
				to change it.
				
				Note: whenever a Yaroze machine is reset, it reverts
				to its default video mode; for European Yarozes,
				this will be PAL.
				
		(2)		Even if you don't have the source code of a program,
				you can often force it into a given mode
				(most programs do not explicitly set it);
				see the sample program directory vidmode\proper,
				invoke the batch files <tellme>, <ntsc> and <pal> 
				to find and set video mode respectively.

		NOTE: both the above changes change video mode ONLY;
		this is enough to guarantee correct colour.

		The problem is that other aspects of game programs are
		dependent on video mode and need altering as it changes;
		e.g. whether the bottom left of frame buffer can be used
		for textures, the screen resolution and the screen offset.
		To ensure that a game looks good under both modes, a small
		amount of care must be taken; it is usually not hard.
		
		Refer to the sample program 3dtunnel to see how to make 
		a program that looks fine under both video modes.

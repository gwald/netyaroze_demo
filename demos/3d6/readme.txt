3d demo          Offscreen drawing for dynamic textures



2 Cubes: made out of 16bit dynamically created textures,
a different one per face; hence can draw onto each cube
surface separately.

Have fixed the previously imperfect texturing on the larger, outer cube.


     


Change projection: see the visual effect of this,
also how it affects clipping; use L1 and Rpad

Move the viewpoint in GsRVIEW2:
view always looks from view.vp to view.vr; use L2 and Rpad



Nice simple camera mode: six basic moves, matrix re-sorting


View distance from world origin: use Lright and Rpad to modify


ViewMoveTime: use Lleft and Rpad

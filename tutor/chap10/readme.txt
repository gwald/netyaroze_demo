Net Yaroze Programming Tutorial
Chapter 10 - 3D Graphics

	The following 3D examples are meant to get members
	up and running as quickly as possible.  Read the
	comments and check the Net Yaroze Programming FAQ
	before posting any messages on the newsgroups or
	e-mailing ps_yaroze@playstation.sony.com.

Note!   The 3D lines that appear in the following examples
	are just for effect.  Due to z-sorting problems and
	the near clipping plane, the lines may not appear
	correctly when the viewing distance is effected.

2 -  Generic 3D Application
3 -  Display 3D Model
4 -  Parallel and Perspective Projection
5 -  Object Rotation (X axis, Y axis, Z axis)
6 -  Object Translation (X plane, Y plane, Z plane)
